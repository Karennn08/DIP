Geometric Scaling - ZOOM: modify image size, add info, add pixels, that arent real, just an interpolation of other pixels

it is a 2 steps strategy:
1 generate matrix with ideal size
2 give new values to the matrix using the original values:
-nearest neighbor -> pixels fill with the nearest real pixel value. Repeat values
-interpolation (bilineal and bicubic) -> dependig the interpolation function new positions are generated.
-filter based -> 
-convolutional super resolution ->
This resizing is often necessary in order to feed models of AI.


Gray scale transformation: 
Non linear transformation, spacial domain. is applied to each pixel

must satisfy 2 things:
1 single values and monotonically increasing in interval 0 < r <1
2 the resulting values 0 < T < 1
L maximum dinamic range

- NEGATIVE: from (0 L-1) to (L-1 to 0) inverts the colors
- LOGARITMIC: s = c * log(1+r) c determines the maximum value, be careful not to overload, improve visualization of dark regions
- EXPONENTIAL: gama constant, s = c * r
r<1 similar logaritmic
r = 1 identity
r>1 similar exponential
