Dip entra imagen sale imagen, filtrado
computer vision emula la vision humana, toma decisiones con lo que ve, reconoce imagenes interpresta escenas, medidas sobre un ibjeto

DIP ejemplo: aplicar filtro para mejorar bordes en rayos x 
VC ejemplo: recomocimiento y seguimiento de un organo en una secuencia de imagenes

General DIP outline:
problem domain -> acquisition -> enhancement/pre processing (allows better interpretation/could be the last step) -> restoration 
-> motphological processing (related to the shape of the objects in the image) -> segmentation (decomposition of an image into its parts) 
-> object recognition (group by characteristics) -> representation and description 
-> colour image processing (more computationally expensive) - image compression (optimal way of storing)

A digital image: to obtain digital image sampling is needed. Digital image is a two dimensional representation 
made up of pixels (so image is an approximation of a real scene), pixels values represents gray levels, colours, opacities..

Grayscale -> 1 sample per point (black or white)
RGB -> 3 sample per point 
RGB + opacity (alpha) -> 4 samples per point

Ultrasound -> TASK

Sampling (Resolution) -> sample frequency, discret set points (samples) 
Quantization (intensity levels / dynamic range) -> assigning discrete valuess to the samples, 8 bits (0 black to 255 white)

IMAGE PROPIETIES:
Resolution -> pixels
Colour depth -> # of bits used to represent each pixels
File fromat -> the way image data is stored in a file (jpg* png bmp tiff webp* // dicom nifti) *Lightweight 
Metadata -> extra details
compression
Channels
Histogram -> graphical representation of the distribution of pixel intensities. H(i) = n sub i
Brightness -> overall lightness or darkness (IS LIKE A MATHEMATICAL AVERAGE)
Sharpness -> measure of how well defined and detailed the edges appear. (LAPLACIANO / DIRECTIONAL DERIVATIVE)
Contrast -> (IS LIKE A MATHEMATICAL STANDARD DEVIATION)
