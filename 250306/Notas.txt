Color properties:
Radiance
luminance
brightness

We see red, green and blue. primary. This is for light, pigments are another story
Magenta, cyan, yellow. secundary

NOt all colors can be represented by monitors, there are a triangular of accuracy


COLOR SPACES MODELS:
3 dimencional coordinated system
RGB -> monitors, cameras
CMYK (k its combination of all 3, not good quality, couse of that printers add extra black ink) -> printers
YIQ -> TV transmission

Cubic representation of RGB


Other spaces:
HSI color space: hue, saturation, intensity

Conversion between rgb and hsi
it has 3 formulas for H, S and I


YCBCR -> espacio con diferencias entre blue y red


APPLICATIONS:

working on different spaces if for different applications. Spaces allow us to separate information of an image.
In medical image is very important cause color can determinate a patology.
Pattern recognition for neaural network


RGB -> easy to understand, widely use
HSI -> SEPARATE COLOR AND INTENSITY, intuitive, non linearity
YCBCR -> SEPARATE COLOR AND INTENSITY, efficience for compressison, complex transformation between spaces


Segmentation -> separate backround and interest objects

Imbinarize -> en matlab pone un umbral para asignar que es fondo y que es objto de interes (hay global y adaptativo con metodo de otsu-> SE CALCULA CON HIST y su desv estandar)

Separar basada en similitudes:
